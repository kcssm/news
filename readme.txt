=== _gpp ===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called _gpp. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

=== Getting Started ===

The first thing you want to do is copy the _gpp directory and change the name to something else. Like, say, instamate. Then you'll need to do a three-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for _gpp inside single quotations to capture the text domain.
2. Search for _gpp_ for to capture all the function names
3. Search for _gpp- for to capture all the css class names
3. Search for _gpp with a space before it to replace all the occurrences of it in comments. (You'd replace this with the capitalized version of your theme name.)

or ...

Search for:'_gpp'
Replace with:'instamate'
Search for:_gpp_
Replace with:instamate_
Search for:_gpp-
Replace with:instamate-
Search for: _gpp
Replace with: Instamate

Then, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
